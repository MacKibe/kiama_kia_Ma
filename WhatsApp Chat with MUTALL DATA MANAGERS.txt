Hello i won't be able to join you for the foreseeable future.  I had an application for a job that came early than expected and i didn't get a chance to inform you on that. Sorry for any inconveniences......

I think this is something to be proud about....rather than be sorry. That's why I copied the message to the group.

3/21/23, 21:20 - Mr. Muraya: Carol, it's your day tomorrow. Make the morning session work for you. Start by presenting refined minutes of last time, grouped under headings that match your portfolio. Please emphasize the issues that came out, the suggestions that were given to you. To hen tell us what has transpired within the last 2 weeks...your discoveries, lessons learnt and give indications where your work is headed.

3/22/23, 19:34 - Mr. Muraya: Here they are.
3/22/23, 20:26 - James: its me
3/22/23, 20:27 - James: noted.
3/22/23, 20:52 - Mr. Muraya: Thanks
3/22/23, 20:56 - Mr. Muraya: Peter, I have noted the changes to the websocket system. Thanks. Looks more polished on my mobile.  3 other issues to look at:-
3/22/23, 20:56 - Mr. Muraya: 1. Change the heading to something like:
3/22/23, 20:57 - Mr. Muraya: Testing a messaging system for mutall interns
3/22/23, 21:01 - Mr. Muraya: 2. Save the user name to the window' registry, do that we don't have to type in every time we want to chart. Only when the registry is empty should we enter it. 3. Drop the milliseconds in the time signature. 4. Consider saving the messages to a database
3/22/23, 21:06 - Mr. Muraya: Another websocket idea: if a message is sent via this chart application and you are logged in to a mutall app, e.g., tracker, you can see the message in the tracker message pannel
3/22/23, 21:59 - Peter Mutall: 1 & 2 sorted, 3 & 4(idea),noted.
3/23/23, 08:18 - Mr. Muraya: To address point 4, and most other issues that will arise after many more programmers have see this version, consider the following:
3/23/23, 08:19 - Mr. Muraya: Define a class, say mutall_socket, whose constructor must be very well document.
3/23/23, 08:21 - Mr. Muraya: Define a method, say, send_message(text:sting): result...
3/23/23, 08:22 - Mr. Muraya: The structure of result should tell the programmer whether the message was sent or not. If not, why?
3/23/23, 08:23 - Mr. Muraya: That's all. Programmers can extend this class to do what they want.
3/23/23, 08:25 - Mr. Muraya: I mean a javascript class
3/23/23, 08:27 - Peter Mutall: There's actually one that I had began to develop, earlier on..
3/23/23, 08:30 - Mr. Muraya: I'd like to test it; or better still, develop a test sample code..,the equivalent of 'hello world'
3/23/23, 08:34 - Peter Mutall: Noted
3/23/23, 08:36 - Mr. Muraya: Furthermore, the 'why failed' aspect of the result need not be understanble by ordinary mortals, but it is an output which if I sent you, you would immediately know what has gone wrong, helping to solve the pronlem
3/23/23, 08:37 - Peter Mutall: I will take that into consideration.
3/23/23, 08:39 - Peter Mutall: You were to help me out in pushing the Payments agenda forward, how should I proceed?
3/23/23, 08:43 - Kang'ara: Good morning, I will not make it to the office today
3/23/23, 08:46 - Mr. Muraya: Help me to get a till number for my personal account no. 01109583919300. Name:Peter K.Muraya, Coop Bank Kiserian branch

3/27/23, 07:59 - Peter Mutall: These changes are made to improve the security of our server as a result of some malicious activity noted on that server.
3/27/23, 07:59 - Peter Mutall: Good day to you all

4/4/23, 20:59 - Mr. Muraya: Do you know of a structure called Map ( in any programming language?). Read about it. Kangara, you need it for solving the current cell_id problem. In general, you need a map when the order in which you insert keys matter. I will have a joint session on maps tommorrow. Join us if interested.
4/4/23, 22:01 - Kang'ara: Okay

4/14/23, 10:11 - Mr. Muraya: The position for the chicken foot is not very clear. Clarify this before printing it
4/14/23, 10:12 - George Mutall: okay.
4/14/23, 10:14 - Mr. Muraya: Kangara, please send me (by copy and pasting here) the code for the  crown.show() method
4/14/23, 10:15 - Peter Mutall: Yes, there is, but there are some fixes that need to be done, some sockets dont have power
4/14/23, 10:15 - Mr. Muraya: Carol, is the chicken foot marker functional now?
4/14/23, 10:16 - Kang'ara: Okay
4/14/23, 10:17 - Mr. Muraya: Ask njau to put sockets in our office to do away with all the extension cables
4/14/23, 10:17 - Peter Mutall: We have informed Njau the electrician of that. Okay
4/14/23, 10:18 - Peter Mutall: Okay.
4/14/23, 10:20 - Mr. Muraya: Also, have a look at Kibes data and jointly sketch a model that we can discuss
4/14/23, 10:20 - Mr. Muraya: Mwanikis data, as well
4/14/23, 10:23 - Mr. Muraya: Kaniu, I have thot thru the kentonary interface; let's discuss it next week at your convenience
4/14/23, 11:12 - Hallelujah: Ok Sir, thanks.
4/14/23, 11:24 - Kang'ara: You deleted this message
4/14/23, 12:15 - Kang'ara: http://206.189.207.206/kangara/school/code/exam.ts
4/14/23, 12:51 - Mr. Muraya: Unable to view a ts file on my phone. Why not copy paste the method I requested here
4/14/23, 12:56 - Kang'ara: On it
4/15/23, 11:46 - Mr. Muraya: Carol, consider making metavisuo the default subject in our application interface. Do you understand what I mean?
4/15/23, 15:22 - Mr. Muraya: Peter, now that you have sorted out the technical chat issues, can we revisit our messenger. The key item is to recognize socket technology alongside email, twilio and mobitech sms
4/15/23, 15:28 - Peter Mutall: Yeah, but there are some issues, I will point out, that might improve/change how we are looking at that messenger
4/15/23, 15:39 - Mr. Muraya: List them
4/15/23, 16:26 - Peter Mutall: The messenger panel, in the app.main page supports messages that you can reply to, but chats should have a dedicated input from which you could respond to. So there is need to separate both messages.
4/18/23, 09:26 - Mr. Muraya: I'm unable to participate in the morning session because I will be late and I cannot read any of your minutes. Please convert them from md to html MANUALLY as agreed. Automation comes later.
4/18/23, 10:32 - Peter Mutall: I have developed some sort of Interface to help you to do that, kindly take a look at it. Someone else will pick it up from there..
4/18/23, 11:18 - Mr. Muraya: Deploy the interface, so that I don't have to try accessing the raw .md file....Nevertheless, why are the others finding it hard to convert an md file to a html?? My immediate interest is by the fastest means possible be able to read the daily minutes. George had a good presentation now, which I could not follow then. I have some time now as I take coffee; I would like to read the minutes now now, while the presentation is still hot.
4/18/23, 11:31 - Peter Mutall: There is an interface to view the markdown files, for each presenter
4/18/23, 11:32 - Mr. Muraya: Send me the link(s)
4/18/23, 11:33 - Peter Mutall: On the timetable interface, click on Minutes, and you should see an interface
4/18/23, 11:44 - Mr. Muraya: Thanks
4/18/23, 11:52 - Mr. Muraya: I have seen the interface.  Navigation is not yet a problem, let's not focus on it. Simplify the interface to that what comes up immediately is the list of all presentations as they appear on disk.My focus right now is on the quality of content of the minutes, and how they relate to the portfolio. Are we making progress towards our goals? Is the progress slow it fast? Who is lagging behind. What can we do to speed him/her up?  How could this joint working session  be improved? If you were called for an interview today, can you present your current work to speak for you?
4/18/23, 18:21 - Mr. Muraya: Home page for the minutes is now looking ok. A few improvements:
4/18/23, 18:22 - Mr. Muraya: -use a tabular layout for the output
4/18/23, 18:22 - Mr. Muraya: -using 2 columns: name and date
4/18/23, 18:24 - Mr. Muraya: -exclude minute files that don't qualify as such
4/18/23, 18:32 - Mr. Muraya: After this lets pay attention to the content of these minutes. My first problem is styling. Can we have it standardized, making it easier to read on phone, project, and viewng on laptop
4/19/23, 18:12 - +254 735 999400: For anyone who is interested, received an email from an online meet up group :-

4/28/23, 08:04 - Mr. Muraya: George, there is an app by Stanbic bank that is targeting chama. It's called 'chama app' or something like that. You see, you are not the only one thinking chamas. You have competition. Download it from appetite and see what your competitors are up to.
4/28/23, 13:49 - Mr. Muraya: 1. Your portfolio follows this pattern. Fine tune it and we shall ask Shallon to standardize all the others

2. Your last Minutes: styling not good on phone

3. portfolio items for which there are no minutes from previous presentations should be ommited. E.g. Image processing

4. Accounting: Present the QuickBooks initiative jointly with Julius next time

5. Deploy Chat via mutall_chama app and the Timetable menu

6. Notification should quietly update the application messages panel as soon as a message is sent. All old chats are visible in the same panel.

6/12/23, 14:31 - Mr. Muraya: Hi kang'ara and chris, we used to have a webpage for friends of Ngong hills conservancy group on mutall co.  Is it still there? Have all the images been transferred to imagery?

6/13/23, 18:46 - Mr. Muraya: Hi peter, did the posting work?
6/13/23, 19:10 - Peter Mutall: There was an error, I am currently debugging it
6/15/23, 07:39 - Mr. Muraya: Good morning Data Managers, I won't be in office today.
6/15/23, 07:47 - Mr. Muraya: Sorry, peter I did not get time to look at the code. I'm travelling. It looks like this part of the code is still in php 7.4 and therefore  has never been debugged in 8.1. Try this: The ::: poster() function has a postage parameter in it's definition. Give it a default value of true. E.g., 
function poster( bool $postage=true)
6/15/23, 08:00 - Mr. Muraya: If this default value gives unexpected results, try the opposite, =false. Feed me back.
6/15/23, 08:16 - Mr. Muraya: In addition...help Anne to develop her portfolio. Here are some ideas:
1. Python
Objective:Raise proficiency in using python+ advanced libraries among ourselves, championed by Anne
Problem: Is establishing a paid parking service feasible or not?
Plan: Use the carpark data and a python library to do some basic statistics that summaries the collected data
Outcome:An incite into our carpark usage and potential as a cash generator
Monitoring&Evaluation: Fortnightly report on progress, through our morning plenary sessions
6/15/23, 08:18 - +254 787 697771: Morning to you too 
I faced problems creating the relationship between a portfolio and a portfolio item due to the existing records in the portfolio_items table.
6/15/23, 08:19 - Mr. Muraya: 2. Suggest another more manual hands on piece of assignment that allow Anne to explore our tools and methods
6/15/23, 08:19 - Mr. Muraya: This assignment must be beneficial to our group
6/15/23, 08:31 - Peter Mutall: Okay, Will do...
6/15/23, 08:31 - Peter Mutall: Okay, I will do this too
6/15/23, 10:11 - Mr. Muraya: Make a copy of the database. Empty the original by Truncating. Establish the relationships. Transfer data from the copy to the original
6/15/23, 14:08 - Peter Mutall: I think the problem was at the fix, I ran into another error that I did not understand its origin, so I re-Downloaded the library to the version of the server, and *Since* the naming format was okay for the electricity display query, it successfully posted the data. 


Running the display for the next month's data, the opening balance is reflecting the previous month's closing balance, with all the wreading, payment, debit, Electricity,and Credit all reset to *0*


To confirm that everything is okay, in the database, I confirmed that the payments, debit, and credit have an Invoice PK associated with them.
6/15/23, 14:09 - Peter Mutall: From this, I will load the water data and then proceed to upload the database to the server
6/15/23, 14:34 - Mr. Muraya: In short... you solved both the electricity sharing and posting problems?
6/15/23, 14:35 - Peter Mutall: Yeah
6/15/23, 14:35 - Mr. Muraya: Thanks.
